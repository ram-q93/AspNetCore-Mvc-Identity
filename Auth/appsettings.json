// why MultipleActiveResultSets=true  ????
//This can happen if you execute a query while iterating over the results 
//from another query. It is not clear from your example where this happens because the example is not complete.
//One thing that can cause this is lazy loading triggered when iterating over the results of some query.
//This can be easily solved by allowing MARS in your connection string. 
//Add MultipleActiveResultSets=true to the provider part of your connection string (where Data Source, Initial Catalog, etc. are specified).
